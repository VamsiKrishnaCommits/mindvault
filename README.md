# MindVault

## Inspiration
The inspiration for MindVault emerged from a common frustration with digital note-taking. While tools like Google Keep and Notion are great for saving content, they often become cluttered over time, making it difficult to find specific information later. We wanted to create a solution that automatically organizes saved content, ensuring that when users revisit their notes, they find a well-structured library with proper classification and source references.


MindVault is a Chrome extension that helps you save and categorize content from various platforms (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn and more) using AI-powered classification and summarization.

## Features

- Save posts/tweets with one click
- AI-powered content categorization
- Automatic content summarization
- Cross-platform support (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, and more)
- Text selection saving
- Organized content management console

## Prerequisites

Before installing the extension, you need to enable several Chrome flags and APIs:

### 1. Enable Gemini Nano

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
2. Enable "BypassPerfRequirement"
3. Relaunch Chrome

### 2. Enable Prompt API

1. Go to `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
2. Select "Enabled"
3. Relaunch Chrome

### 3. Verify Gemini Nano Availability

1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Run: `(await ai.languageModel.capabilities()).available;`
3. Should return "readily"

If not "readily" available:
1. Run `await ai.languageModel.create();` in console (may fail, but that's okay)
2. Relaunch Chrome
3. Go to `chrome://components`
4. Check for "Optimization Guide On Device Model" version ‚â• 2024.5.21.1031
5. Click "Check for update" if needed

### 4. Enable Summarization API

1. Navigate to `chrome://flags/#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano`
2. Select "Enabled"
3. Relaunch Chrome
4. Run in console: `await ai.summarizer.create();`
